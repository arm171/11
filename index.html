            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Arman Vermishyan. For most of my life, I was a football player — not just by skill, but by heart. Football was my world, my discipline, my identity. But life doesn’t always follow the path we choose. <br><br> After multiple injuries and three serious surgeries, I had to say goodbye to the only life I ever knew. I lost football, but I didn’t lose myself. Instead, I started building something new. <br><br> Today, I’m walking a new path — frontend development. I still have that fire in me. The same hunger to grow, to push myself, and to become something more. <br><br> I believe in hard work, in learning every day, and in using the pain of the past as fuel for the future.</p>

            <h2>What I’ve Learned in the Last 3 Years</h2>
            <p>These years have been the hardest of my life — not just physically, but emotionally. <br><br> After surgery, when your body is weak, and your mind is full of questions, you learn to wait. <br> You learn to accept silence. <br> You learn to live one day at a time. <br><br> I taught myself how to do recovery exercises. I pushed myself to walk again. I faced moments of fear and doubt, but I never stopped believing that I would find a new purpose. <br><br> And I did — I discovered coding. It became my new field, my new discipline. I may not run on a football pitch anymore, but I keep moving — one line of code at a time.</p>

        <section class="achievements" id="achievements">
            <h2>My Personal Achievements</h2>
            <p>I used to wear a football jersey, now I wear responsibility. <br><br>In sport, I earned respect — not because I scored the most goals, but because of who I was on and off the field. Even rivals respected me, because I gave my heart to the game. <br><br>In life, my greatest achievement is simple: I never gave up. <br>Even when I felt lost, even when I had to rebuild myself from zero — I kept going. <br><br>That’s who I am — not the strongest, not the fastest, but someone who never stops.</p>

            <h2>Projects & Practice</h2>
            <p>I’m still learning. But even at the start of my journey, I’ve already built things with meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A football player card, because football is still in my soul</li>
                <li>A recipe page, because rebuilding life is also about routine and care</li>
                <li>A personal portfolio, because I believe my future has a place on the web</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I don't rush. I build slowly, like healing bones. But I build with honesty and passion. This is only the beginning.</p>

            <h2>Other Interests</h2>
            <p>I’ve always loved competition, strategy, and focus — which is why I’m also passionate about esports. <br><br>It’s not “just a game” to me — it’s a space where reaction, logic, and leadership matter. <br>Just like in football — and just like in coding — every small decision counts.</p>
